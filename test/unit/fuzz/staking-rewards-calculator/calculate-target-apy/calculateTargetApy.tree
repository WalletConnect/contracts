├── given total stake weight is 0
│   └── it should return base APY (12.0808%)
├── given total stake weight is less than 1M
│   ├── it should calculate APY with proper scaling
│   └── it should not exceed base APY
├── given total stake weight is greater than 1M
│   ├── it should decrease APY linearly with stake weight
│   └── it should maintain precision
└── given total stake weight would result in negative APY
    └── it should return minimum APY (0%)
