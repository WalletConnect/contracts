│   └── it should return zero
├── when querying supply at the current block
│   └── it should match the regular totalSupply
├── when querying supply at a block with active locks
│   ├── it should return the sum of all active locks at that block
│   └── it should be less than or equal to the current totalSupply
├── when querying supply at a block after some locks have expired
│   ├── it should only include non-expired locks in the total supply
│   └── it should be less than the original totalSupply

│   └── it should return zero
├── when locks have different durations
│   └── it should correctly calculate partial lock values
├── when querying supply backwards after creating locks
│   ├── it should increase as we query backwards
│   └── it should match the initial supply at the start block
├── when querying across epoch boundaries
│   └── it should correctly interpolate values between epochs
└── when querying a future block
    └── it should revert with BadBlockNumber error
