│   └── it should revert
├── when querying supply at the current time
│   └── it should match the regular totalSupply
├── when querying supply at a time with active locks
│   ├── it should return the sum of all active locks at that time
│   └── it should be less than or equal to the current totalSupply
├── when querying supply at a time with permanent locks
│   ├── it should include permanent positions with constant weight
│   └── it should not decay permanent positions over time
├── when querying supply at a time after conversion to permanent
│   ├── it should show decaying weight before conversion
│   └── it should show constant weight after conversion
├── when querying supply at a time after some locks have expired
│   ├── it should only include non-expired locks in the total supply
│   └── it should be less than the original totalSupply
├── when querying supply at a time after all locks have expired
│   └── it should return zero
├── when locks have different durations
│   └── it should correctly calculate partial lock values
├── when querying supply into the future
│   ├── it should decrease over time as locks expire
│   └── it should eventually return zero when all locks expire
└── when querying supply backwards after warping time
    ├── it should increase as we query backwards
    └── it should match the initial supply at the start time
