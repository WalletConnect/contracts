checkpointTotalSupply.t.sol
├── when _checkpointTotalSupply is executed
│   ├── it should call checkpoint on the StakeWeight contract
│   ├── when weekCursor is less than or equal to rounded current timestamp
│   │   ├── it should iterate through weeks (up to 52 times)
│   │   └── for each iteration
│   │       ├── it should find the timestamp epoch
│   │       ├── it should get the point history for the epoch
│   │       ├── when weekCursor is greater than point timestamp
│   │       │   └── it should calculate time delta
│   │       ├── it should calculate bias
│   │       ├── when point has slope of zero (permanent)
│   │       │   └── it should use constant bias without decay
│   │       ├── when bias is negative
│   │       │   └── it should set totalSupplyAt for the week to 0
│   │       ├── when bias is not negative
│   │       │   └── it should set totalSupplyAt for the week to the calculated bias
│   │       └── it should increment weekCursor by 1 week
│   ├── when weekCursor becomes greater than rounded current timestamp
│   │   └── it should break the loop
│   └── it should update the contract's weekCursor to the new value
├── when permanent positions exist
│   ├── it should correctly record constant supply for permanent weeks
│   └── it should handle mixed permanent and decaying supplies
└── when StakeWeight contract is not set in config
    └── it should revert
