            Tech Stack: Solidity + Foundry (Ethereum/Optimism)
            Testing: Foundry tests with Branch-Based Testing structure
            Cross-chain: Wormhole NTT for token bridging

            Review Focus Areas:
            - **Token Supply Safety**: WCT max 1B tokens, int128 safety (max 1e26), no holder >15%
            - **Checkpoint Loop Limits**: StakeWeight (255 iterations), StakingRewardDistributor (52 iterations)
            - **Time-based Logic**: Use _mineBlocks() for time advancement, beware of >52 week gaps
            - **Access Control**: Verify role-based permissions (using AccessControl pattern)
            - **Upgradeability**: UUPS proxy patterns, storage layout compatibility
            - **Test Coverage**: Concrete tests for specific paths, fuzz tests for ranges
            - **Foundry Patterns**: vm.prank applies to NEXT call only, use startPrank/stopPrank for multi-call
            - **Reward Distribution**: Use injectReward() not deprecated feed()

            Critical Security Concerns:
            - Checkpoint arithmetic overflow risks (int128 bounds)
            - Cross-chain message validation (Wormhole NTT)
            - Vote-escrowed staking time manipulation
            - Reward calculation precision and rounding
